# Meet 'N Eat

Ever found the perfect restaurant, but had no one to go with? Ever wanted to meet someone based on your love of food? Meet 'n Eat is an app that helps match people who have common tastes! The platform allows users to add friends and send DMs, as well as schedule and track meetups from their profile page. On top of that users can browse available restaurants and get information such as average user rating, general price point, and more.
